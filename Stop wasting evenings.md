# 8 things I did to stop wasting my evenings after work

## Introduction [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=0s)

- Many people spend their workdays looking forward to their free time, but when the evening arrives, they often waste it by scrolling mindlessly, watching random videos, or feeling too tired to do anything meaningful [(00:00:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=7s).

- This pattern of behavior was once common, with evenings being a blur of exhaustion and missed opportunities [(00:00:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=22s).

- However, a transformation occurred, and new strategies were discovered for spending after-work hours more productively [(00:00:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=29s).

- The strategies to be discussed are not rigid rules or unrealistic routines, but rather proven, simple changes that work with one's natural energy [(00:00:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=42s).

- These strategies can transform evenings from recovery time into growth time [(00:00:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=52s).

- Eight powerful systems will be explored to help reclaim evenings, covering topics such as energy management, digital wellness, psychological techniques, and practical habits [(00:00:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=59s).

- The goal is to provide everything needed to turn evenings into the best part of the day [(00:01:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=75s).

  

## Chapter 1: "Routines & Structure" [(00:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=79s)

- The way people spend their evenings shapes their entire life, but most individuals focus on time management instead of energy management when trying to fix their after-work hours [(00:01:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=82s).

- A person's evening is not just about the time on the clock, but also about their energy levels, mental state, and ability to enjoy life after work [(00:01:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=96s).

- The shutdown ritual is a simple yet effective practice that involves standing up, taking three deep breaths, and physically closing the laptop after finishing work to signal to the brain that work mode is off [(00:01:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=109s).

- The 90-minute evening block system is a strategy that involves breaking the evening into smaller blocks of time, as the brain naturally works in 90-minute focus cycles [(00:02:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=130s).

- The evening can be divided into three power blocks: recovery, growth, and connection, each serving a different purpose, such as decompression, learning, and quality time with family or friends [(00:02:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=147s).

- Reverse scheduling is an approach that involves planning the evening from the desired sleep time and working backward, as the evening has a greater impact on the morning than vice versa [(00:03:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=189s).

- The two-minute evening reset involves taking a short break to physically reset the space, clear the desk, adjust the lighting, and change clothes when switching activities to create a profound impact [(00:03:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=195s).

  

## Chapter 2: "Digital Wellness" [(00:03:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=216s)

- A well-designed evening requires digital boundaries, as devices like phones and laptops can drain energy and potential, much like vampires in old movies [(00:03:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=223s).

- To establish digital boundaries, one approach is "app mortality," which involves deleting one app from the phone every evening, with the option to reinstall it the next day if needed [(00:04:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=244s).

- Another approach is the "analog hour," where devices are turned off and put in a different room one hour before bedtime, turning the bedroom into a sanctuary [(00:04:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=261s).

- Digital minimalism is not about living without technology, but about using it intentionally, such as choosing only three essential apps for the evening and avoiding digital noise [(00:04:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=283s).

- "Screen life separation tactics" can be used to create physical barriers between individuals and their screens, such as keeping chargers in the kitchen, laptops in a drawer, and using a real alarm clock instead of a phone [(00:05:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=301s).

- These small changes can build a "fortress around your evening" and help individuals unlock the evening they deserve [(00:05:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=320s).

- The goal is to make technology serve the evening, rather than stealing it, by implementing these strategies and approaches [(00:05:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=325s).

  

## Chapter 3: "Psychological Techniques" [(00:05:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=334s)

- Psychological techniques can transform after-work hours by changing how one thinks about and interacts with their environment, as seen in personal experiences and those of hundreds of others [(00:05:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=336s).

- The brain does not distinguish between digital light and sunlight, making it essential to establish "digital sunset protocols" to transition away from screens effectively [(00:06:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=362s).

- Creating an "evening sanctuary" with dim lights, soft textures, and calm colors can signal to the brain that it's time for transformation, speaking directly to the subconscious mind [(00:06:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=378s).

- "Future self journaling" involves writing a letter to one's morning self, focusing on how one wants to feel, allowing the brain to reverse-engineer the path to those feelings [(00:06:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=403s).

- Adopting the "evening energy debt mindset" means viewing the evening as an investment in tomorrow's energy reserves, rather than borrowed time that needs to be paid back [(00:07:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=424s).

- The "decision elimination strategy" involves eliminating as many decisions as possible in the evening, such as laying out clothes and pre-planning meals, to conserve decision-making energy [(00:07:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=444s).

  

## Chapter 4: "Mindfulness and Emotional Intelligence Practices" [(00:07:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=465s)

- Mindfulness and emotional intelligence practices can guide individuals in understanding their emotions, which are signals waiting to be understood, and can be powerful tools for transformation in the evenings [(00:07:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=465s).

- Micro meditation moments, such as feeling the warmth of a cup when pouring evening tea or noticing three points where the body touches the surface when sitting on the couch, can work like hitting a reset button for the mind [(00:08:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=488s).

- Creating an evening awareness protocol by taking 10 seconds every hour to name the current emotion can reduce the power of emotions over an individual by 40% and lead to transformation [(00:08:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=527s).

- Present moment anchoring can be practiced by picking three everyday evening activities, such as brushing teeth or washing dishes, and using them as mindfulness anchors to practice presence [(00:09:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=544s).

- Emotional energy tracking can help individuals identify patterns in their emotions by keeping a simple energy scale from one to 10 and tracking it three times each evening [(00:09:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=572s).

- The evening emotional audit involves asking three simple questions before bed: what energized me today, what drained me, and what surprised me, and can bring freedom by acknowledging emotions [(00:09:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=587s).

- Emotions are not obstacles to overcome but rather messages to decode, and listening to them with curiosity instead of judgment can make them reliable guides to a fulfilled life [(00:10:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=604s).

  

## Chapter 5: "Social Strategies & Dynamics [(00:10:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=619s)

- Mastering social energy is crucial for creating evenings that fill you up instead of leaving you feeling drained and empty, and it can be achieved by implementing a Social Battery Management System [(00:10:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=641s).

- This system involves understanding that some activities charge you up, while others drain you down, and figuring out your unique pattern to avoid spreading yourself thin [(00:10:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=659s).

- Building three to five deep connections with people who understand your needs for connection and space is essential for creating an evening tribe [(00:11:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=672s).

- Energy vampires are people whose energy patterns clash with yours, and it's essential to identify them through an energy vampire audit to avoid draining interactions [(00:11:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=691s).

- The social recharge protocol involves planning 15 minutes of quiet time for every hour of social interaction to recharge and avoid burnout [(00:11:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=714s).

- This protocol can be thought of as a safety net, allowing you to cool down after social interactions and recharge your energy [(00:11:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=709s).

- Shifting your perspective to view connection as productivity can help you realize that evening conversations can actually recharge your creativity, problem-solving, and emotional resilience [(00:12:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=730s).

- Mapping your social energy can help you understand how to balance connection and productivity, leading to more fulfilling evenings [(00:12:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=742s).

  

## Chapter 6: " Creative Approaches for Habit Formation [(00:12:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=744s)

- Understanding the social aspects of evenings can help create lasting habits, and building evening habits is about becoming an architect of small, powerful actions that transform life naturally [(00:12:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=766s).

- Micro habit stacking involves stacking tiny habits together, each taking less than 30 seconds, to create a natural flow of actions [(00:13:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=786s).

- Finding an evening Keystone habit, such as making a cup of tea, can trigger a series of other habits and create a natural flow [(00:13:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=816s).

- Creating a wheel of four different activities, such as reading, drawing, music, or crafts, can provide variety and prevent evening boredom [(00:14:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=840s).

- The daily experiment protocol involves trying one tiny new thing each evening, such as sitting in a different chair or using a non-dominant hand, to keep the brain flexible and evenings interesting [(00:14:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=856s).

- Creative cross-pollination involves letting evening activities blend together naturally, such as doodling guitar cord patterns or acting out scenes from a book, to create new neural pathways and prevent boredom [(00:14:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=885s).

- Embracing the idea of a creative "downtime" period, where energy is low, is not a failure but rather the brain's natural reset, and these quiet moments can prepare for the next creative burst [(00:15:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=907s).

  

## Chapter 7: "Energy Management: Cognitive & Physical Optimization [(00:15:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=930s)

- Cognitive and physical optimization are crucial for sustaining habits, and understanding how to manage them can significantly impact after-work hours [(00:15:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=931s).

- To manage energy, incorporate tiny bites of movement throughout the evening, such as standing up every 30 minutes, stretching for 60 seconds, and doing five jumping jacks between tasks, which serve as energy boosters rather than exercise [(00:15:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=958s).

- Evening energy follows a natural curve, dipping from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m., rising from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., and then gradually descending after 9:00 p.m. to prepare for sleep [(00:16:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=976s).

- Working with this energy curve, rather than against it, is key to mastering evening energy [(00:16:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=989s).

- Conducting an energy audit by rating energy levels every hour from 1 to 10 and tracking activities, eating habits, and thoughts can help identify patterns and discover which activities drain or recharge energy [(00:16:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=998s).

- Mental energy preservation is essential, as the brain has a finite amount of decision-making power each day, and by evening, it is running low [(00:16:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1018s).

- Establishing an evening thought diet involves being selective about how to use remaining mental energy, avoiding "junk food" for the brain like social media scrolling and opting for "brain nutrition" like deep conversations or creative work [(00:17:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1028s).

- Understanding and honoring natural rhythms is crucial for transforming evenings from exhausting to energizing, rather than trying to push through tiredness [(00:17:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1046s).

  

## Chapter 8: "Integration Strategies" [(00:17:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1056s)

- Integration strategies are the framework that makes all other evening practices stick together, serving as a daily bridge between work and life, rather than a solid wall that creates tension [(00:17:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1061s).

- A life-work separation ritual can be achieved by building a 15-minute transition space, or "bridge," with each step moving further from work mode and closer to life mode [(00:18:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1083s).

- Boundaries are not about building walls, but rather about gentle, consistent guidance, similar to training a puppy [(00:18:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1095s).

- When work tries to creep into the evening, it's essential to guide attention back to personal life gently, rather than fighting it [(00:18:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1106s).

- The whole life integration framework ties everything together, with the evening being the foundation of life, and every evening activity either building or draining life's energy [(00:18:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1117s).

- Choosing activities that fill you up, creating spaces that lift your spirit, and building relationships that light up your world are key to transforming the evening into a daily celebration of personal growth [(00:18:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtGn6s7ljHk&t=1127s).
